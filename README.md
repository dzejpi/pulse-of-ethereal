## My commentary
I always wanted to create a rhythm based game. Close enough! I was picturing a grim powerful hardstyle, but this should be good enough too. I'm feeling more and more confident in 3D, but those rotation vectors are still making my head hurt.
Created in Godot 3.5 so that you can all play it in your browser right away!
